\section{Scenarios}
The basic idea behind our visualization system is to present a visual overview
of the most salient objects in text document, without resorting to reading the
text documents one-by-one to get a summary of their contents. Here we present
several scenarios to illustrate our visualization system in action.

\subsection{Buying a Used Vehicle}
The family sedan has been in service for the past 10 years and is starting to
show its age. Michael, the owner and primary provider for his family of four had 
been thinking of buying a new sedan for the past three month and have been saving 
up for the big purchase. With the budgeting concerns more or less taken care of, 
Michael wants to make sure that the next family car is reliable and built by a 
manufacturer with a proven track record on safety standards. With these in mind, 
Michael decides that he does not want to buy the new models coming out this year, 
he believes it is too much risk buying new vehicles that has not been tested by 
drivers in real life. Michael starts off his search by talking to his friends and 
colleagues at work to get a sense of how they feel about certain manufacturers, 
and to get a sense of how their vehicles performed up-to-date. In his second step, 
Michael conducts research on various consumer product review websites to see how 
the expert rank the automotive manufacturers and their specific vehicles in terms 
of safety and reliability ratings, he also browsed open forums to see what type of 
problems can arise from current owners. Michael finds his search helpful but quite 
tedious because the information is difficult to digest; often the data is quite 
generic and provide no link to detailed information. After a week of searching, 
Michael finally picked out three potential models that he believes will meet 
his requirements, he contacted the used car dealerships to come in for a closer 
look in person.

\subsection{Investigating a Possible Problem}
Larry owns a 2009 Toyota Corolla; for the past two or three weeks while driving
on city streets he noticed a strange intermittent vibration coming from near the 
front-passenger side of the his car. Larry is mulling over whether to contact the 
dealership to have them do a checkup, he does not want to spend the time and
money to fix what might be a trivial issue, but at the same time he is worried that his 
might develop into a major problem which would cost more in the long run. He 
checked on the web to see if there are any other owners with the same issues, after 
browsing multiple forums and looking through all the owner complaints with similar 
characteristics he found about a dozen instances with half of them leading to more 
serious suspension issues. Larry decides that these provides more than enough evidence 
that the car may have a serious problem, he contacts the dealership to make 
appointment for a checkup.
